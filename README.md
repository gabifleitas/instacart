# instacart

## Project part of the Tripleten bootcamp.

This project aims to explore, clean, and analyse data from the Instacart delivery platform to discover patterns in the purchasing habits of its users. The dataset, originally published for a competition on Kaggle, was modified to suit the learning environment: the volume was reduced, and missing and duplicate values were introduced, respecting the actual distributions.

Instacart enables individuals to order groceries online and have them delivered to their homes, similar to other platforms like Uber Eats. The database includes detailed information on millions of orders, products, aisles, departments, and shopping habits. This project allows you to apply data analysis skills to generate informative graphs, work with complex structures, and use Python and Pandas for processing.

Key tasks include verifying data types, handling missing and duplicate values, visualizing data with clear graphs, and analyzing behavior by hour, day of the week, product, and customer. Upon completion of the project, you will have a clear understanding of consumer behaviour on the platform and be prepared to communicate relevant findings effectively.
